# Robofriends App

A simple app that connects to an API which randomly generates robots pictures based on its name(or basically anything you type). 
The names and the cards infos are in the robots.js file. 

## To run it:

```
1 - Clone it to a directory you want;
```

```
2 - Install its dependencies/modules by running "npm install" in the directory(using a CLI, like cmd);
```
```
3 - Finally, run "npm start" to start the web server in localhost(port 3000) in your browser. 
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
